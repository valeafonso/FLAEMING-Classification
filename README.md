## FLAEMING-Identification of LAEs using broad-band photometry and gradient boosting algorithms

In this repository you can find the notebooks essential to mimic the work described in: "INSERT PAPER LINK". The data needed is can be found in https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/476/4/4725/4858393?login=false (COSMOS2020) and https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ac3078 (SC4K).

If only interested in applying the models, you can also find them already trained and optimized in the folder "Models" together with a brief tutorial of how to access them. Additionally, the predictions table is also directly available.
